# Utility functions
This repository contains a collection of small utility functions organized into different folders. Each folder represents a specific functionality or domain, making it easy to find and use the functions you need.
## Structure
- `duplicate-lines-finder/` - This functionality reads multiple input files, identifies rows that are present in all of these files, and redirects these common rows to a separate output file. It allows users to quickly find and consolidate identical rows across various files into a single file for further analysis or processing.
- `folder2/` - Description of the functions and utilities stored in this folder.
- `folder3/` - Description of the functions and utilities stored in this folder.
## Usage
To use the functions from this library, navigate to the relevant folder and include or import the required functions into your project. Ensure that you follow any specific instructions or dependencies mentioned in the folder's README or documentation files.
